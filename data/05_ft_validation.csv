""in like manner also, that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works. Let a woman learn in silence with all submission. And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self\-control. 1 Timothy 2:9\-15

“Great experience working with Ternwheel

In my many years as an artist, tour manager, and booking agent, I’ve used everything from printed books to spreadsheets to keep things on track. Accessing information on the road is necessary, and technology made it more convenient; but there has never been anything as robust, practical, and user friendly as Ternwheel. Not even close.”

**Anura translates operator intent into autonomous action**
-----------------------------------------------------------


Primordial Labs is developing the next\-generation human\-machine interface, Anura, to empower warfighters to be active collaborators, not passive observers, when teaming with uncrewed systems (UxS).

With Anura, operators can task robots like they would a human teammate by using natural language.


[Meet Anura](/product) 


00:0000:00UnmuteMuteSettingsSpeedNormalSpeedGo back to previous menu0\.5×0\.75×Normal1\.25×1\.5×1\.75×2×Exit fullscreenEnter fullscreen% buffered00:00PlayVideo is not available or format is not supported. Try a different browser.


**Our Approach**
================


Our mission is to build human\-centric autonomy that puts collaboration between the human and robot as priority number one. We believe the path to mass adoption of autonomous systems is to make the communication mechanism, not the robot itself, more human. 

**Anura: Natural Language Understanding \+ Platform\-Agnostic Autonomy**

Anura blends natural language understanding with an embodied autonomous agent to enable speech\-to\-action capabilities for uncrewed systems, battlefield management systems, and more.


![]()


Anura leverages a conversational human\-machine interface (C\-HMI) that translates verbal, mission\-type orders from natural language to complex autonomous platform and sensor behaviors. It does this by extracting and distilling the operator’s intent with respect to the current mission context.


### Natural Language Understanding


![]()


### Platform\-Agnostic Autonomy


Anura’s platform\-agnostic autonomous agent controls platforms, payloads, and sensors based on the operator’s intent extracted by the C\-HMI. This allows Anura to take action in the real world, whether it’s manipulating software or a physical platform.


![]()


**Why Anura?**
==============


Maximize your autonomy stack
----------------------------


Integrate with existing equipment


![]()


Up\-skill existing on\-board automation


![]()


Avoid vendor\-lock


![]()


Empower the warfighter
----------------------


Reduce cognitive burden


![]()


Democratize access to UxS


![]()


Provide heads\-up control in the field


![]()


**Anura makes communicating with robots more human by leveraging natural language**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


![]()


#### Use Case 1:


### Uncrewed System Command \& Control (C2\)


Anura enables warfighters to employ uncrewed systems (UxS) with minimal distractions. Users can task drones using natural language, verbally expressing their intent.

Anura does not listen for key words or require memorizing a script. Instead, Anura extracts and distills the operator’s intent and translates that into autonomous actions for the platform to execute.


![]()


#### Use Case 2:


### Multi\-Domain, Multi\-Agent C2


As the size and complexity of human\-machine integrated formations grows, single operators will be responsible for commanding multiple robots on the battlefield simultaneously. 

Using Anura, operators can task platforms individually via call\-sign (e.g., “Falcon”), or as a team (e.g., “Team Alpha”), using natural language.

Teams can be formations of heterogeneous platforms in the same or different domains.


![]()


### Battlefield Management Systems


#### Use Case 3:


Anura is not limited to the command and control of uncrewed systems. 

Operators and analysts can use Anura to interact with complex software systems such as common operating pictures. Anura’s conversational interface makes complex scene management and large\-scale operations faster, more intuitive, and more natural.

‍**](https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/136352)You should speak with your financial advisor, accountant, and/or attorney when evaluating any offering of securities. Neither Landa Holdings, Landa App, nor Dalmore makes any recommendations or provides advice about investments, and no communication, through this website or in any other medium, should be construed as a recommendation for any security offered on or off this investment platform. Nothing in this material should be construed as investment or tax advice, or a solicitation or offer, or a recommendation to buy or sell any securities. The Site and/or the App may make forward\-looking statements. You should not rely on these statements but should carefully evaluate the offering materials in assessing any investment opportunity, including the complete set of risk factors that are provided as part of the offering circular for your consideration.  We urge you to review the applicable offering circular, available [**here**](https://landa.app/legal).  
  
  
All securities offered by the Landa Entities and Landa Financing are deemed “Shares”. Investing in Shares involves risks, and there is always the potential of losing money when you invest in Shares. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investments in Shares are speculative and involve substantial risks to consider before investing, outlined in the respective offering materials and including, but not limited to, illiquidity, lack of diversification, and complete loss of capital. An investment in Shares constitutes only an investment in a particular offering and not in Landa Holdings, Landa App, or any of the underlying asset(s). Investors should carefully review the risks located in the respective offering materials for a more comprehensive discussion of risks.  
  
‍  
No money or other consideration will be solicited (and if sent, will not be accepted), and no offer to buy Shares of a particular offering can be accepted, and no part of the purchase price can be received until an offering statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") relating to those Shares has been qualified by the SEC. Any such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time before notice of acceptance given after the date of qualification by the SEC. An indication of interest involves no obligation or commitment of any kind.  
  
  
Investment overviews on the Platform contain summaries intended for informational purposes only and are not complete. For detailed information, we urge you to refer to the applicable offering circular filed with the SEC. Neither Landa Holdings nor any of its affiliates offers refunds after an investment has been made.  
  
You should speak with your financial advisor, accountant, and/or attorney when evaluating any Shares. None of Landa Holdings or its affiliates, Dalmore makes any recommendations or provides advice about Shares, and no communication, through this website or in any other medium, should be construed as a recommendation or investment advice. Nothing on the Platform should be construed as investment or tax advice, or a solicitation or offer, or a recommendation to buy or sell any securities.The Platform may make forward\-looking statements. You should not rely on these statements but should carefully evaluate the offering materials in assessing any investment opportunity, including the complete set of risk factors that are provided as part of the offering circular for your consideration. We urge you to review the applicable offering circulars, available [**here**](/legal).  
  
All Shares will be issued in electronic form only and will not be listed or quoted on any securities exchange. After a Series’ offering has concluded, we expect that the Public Private Execution Network Alternative Trading System, or PPEX ATS (the “Secondary Trading Platform”), which is registered with the SEC and operated by North Capital Private Securities Corporation (“North Capital”), will be the only venue available for the resale of Shares. Resales of Shares will be conducted by Dalmore, as a broker\-dealer member of the Secondary Trading Platform; provided, however, any such resale of Shares will be subject to federal and state securities laws and the restrictions in the Series’ Operating Agreement, and there can be no assurance that an active market for any Shares will develop on the Secondary Trading Platform, that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available to allow resales of Shares to residents of all states, or that the Secondary Trading Platform will be available at all. For these reasons, investors must be prepared to hold their Shares indefinitely.

=====================================================================

* Distribute your app in cross\-cloud, edge, on\-prem, on\-device deployments with wasmCloud
* Write shared code once and re\-use in any language that compiles to Wasm
* Zero downtime upgrades without recompiling through runtime\-configuration
[Book a demo](/demo?utm_source=hero&utm_medium=button&utm_content=book_a_demo)How does it work?
-----------------

1Build your app using reusable components in any languageFocus on writing only business logic. Build Wasm components with interfaces, and stop re\-implementing non\-functional requirements. Make use of platform capabilities, existing team components, or open source solutions.2Define your application requirements and configuration as codeUse application manifests to describe requirements. Eliminate the need for recompiling by swapping components and configuration at runtime.3Deploy everywhere and scale automatically through orchestrationwasmCloud is designed to run anywhere—including on your existing infrastructure. Deploy to a VPS, Kubernetes cluster, on\-prem datacenter, or even private edge devices. Our `wadm` orchestrator lets you define where different parts of your application should run.Focus on your unique business needs
-----------------------------------

Stop wasting time rewriting the same non\-functional requirements. We’ll handle the boring stuff, so you can focus on staying ahead of your competition. By building the various parts of your applications as WebAssembly components, you can write apps in the right language for your team.### Focus on writing the right code

By utilizing WASI interfaces, you can make use of the built\-in capabilities that Cosmonic provides and stop re\-implementing the same functionality for every project.### Get APIs for free

Writing your code using interfaces enables isolation and re\-use of existing code in other parts of your application, giving other teams a well documented API.Built\-In Platform CapabilitiesKey\-Value StoreHTTP ClientHTTP ServerBlob StorageMessagingSQL DatabaseTaking distributed applications further
---------------------------------------

Distributed applications aren’t limited to just cloud and edge locations. With Cosmonic, you can build hyper\-distributed applications by deploying them to any cloud, any edge and any device; even on\-prem solutions and customer hardware.Self\-forming and self\-healing Compute MeshBy building on top of the NATS project, you can connect any remote host into your lattice, which is self\-forming, self\-healing, and offers a flat network topology.Cross\-cloud and Multi\-Device DeploymentsWith purpose\-built tools, you can make use of Wasm\-native orchestration to deploy each part of your application to any edge, cloud, or device, with declarative manifests.Compile Once for Many ArchitecturesWasm is made to be portable. Compile your components once, and run them anywhere.Why WebAssembly?
----------------

400MB2MB### Keep your microservices micro

A typical containerized microservice often exceeds 400MB. With Wasm, this shrinks to 2MB or less.### Secure by default

Wasm code executes in a secure sandbox separate from the host. Stop worrying about shared memory and resource exploits.### Write in your team‘s language

Write apps in the languages your team already knows. With components, assemble your team‘s common building blocks in any language.* ![javascript]()![]()

PROPOSALS THAT CLOSE.  
SOFTWARE TO MANAGE THE PROCESS.


Many MSPs struggle with the sales and marketing process. Proposals take too long and version control is a hot mess.


Bizzity is a revenue growth platform that helps MSPs create proposals in a New York minute and track changes allowing them to boost their revenue and focus on what matters most.


[Set up a Demo](#lgb)


What Is Bizzity?


Simply stated, Bizzity is a Software\-as\-a\-Service (SaaS) platform that enables you to have a working and seamless sales process. At the core, there are five parts to the process: Marketing, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Proposals/Documents, Dashboard Analytics, and Workflow automation.


We help you Market


Bizzity integrates to various products to “get the lead in”. Once that happens, Bizzity enables you to continue the marketing process with tasks such as phone calls, SMS messages or Email. Bizzity contains user\-defined Email/SMS templates as well as marketing flows to ensure the marketing process is both defined and repeatable.


![]()


We help you manage **all** contact relationships


Saavy salespeople know that it’s all about a relationship built on trust. Bizzity allows you to keep in touch with suspects, prospects, customers and anyone else with whom you do business however you’d like. Similar to marketing, you have full visibility of past communications and are able to smile and dial, text, or Email right within our app.


![]()


We help you generate beautiful and accurate Proposals / Documents


Fast and attractive proposals are why Bizzity was started. We could not find a product that worked, handled sales tax correctly, and looked good. Bizzity proposals are pixel perfect. Using blocks, you are able to mix and match to get exactly the proposal you are looking for. We also have an icon block which gives you over 1200 icons that you can use (in any color) to enhance your proposals and documents. Add to that an electronic signature platform we developed to secure signatures with ease.


![]()


We keep track “by the numbers”


Someone once said “You can’t expect what you don’t inspect”. Bizzity’s dashboards are real\-time glimpses into your company’s data. By real\-time, we mean real\-time. Usually, dashboards update at periodic intervals; not us. When data changes in the back\-end, any KPIs that rely on that data are updated instantaneously!


Bizzity gives you multiple dashboards to allow for different sets of information to obtain metrics. Dashboards can also be shared across your team for display of common goals.


In addition to KPIs, Bizzity has widgets! Let’s get widgety! Our widgets include clocks (both digital and analog), Bizzity info, and individualized calendars, to name a few.


![]()


We help you get more done with less people/resources


With Bizzity you can create fully custom automated workflows. This enables you to use the product instead of the product using you. Our UI gives you a clear picture of the process from start to finish. This allows you to do more with less. It’s like having an extra employee!

About Us


Our Story


Doing business should not be hard. Sales **absolutely** should not be hard. But, in many cases it is. They say that necessity is the mother of invention. Well, here we are!


Over the years in our other businesses we have used various products to facilitate the sales process. We’ve found that some products were lacking in terms of antiquated or difficult user interfaces, they simply didn’t work and most didn’t handle US sales tax properly.


Each part of our product is based on some “thing” we couldn’t do with other products or where they tried and failed.


This allows the “impossible” to become “possible”.


Our talented and expanding team has developed a fantastic sales platform and we are ready to support and help grow your business.

Founder \& CEO


**Ed Mana**
-----------


Ed’s been an entrepreneur from a young age. Starting his first company at 16, his next at 27, and Bizzity at 48, he has spent his career forming small teams and doing great things.


He attended Polytechnic University (now NYU) for Computer Science in Brooklyn, NY where he was born and raised.


Ed has a unique ability to pivot depending on the audience. One minute you will find him hanging with building maintenance and the next in a meeting with C\-level execs. His people ability and his knack for taking extremely complex concepts and explaining them in plain\-english are some of his greatest strengths.


While not working (which is rare), you will find him spending time with his lovely wife and two of the most awesome kids on the planet.

What is Px?
-----------


Px is a new concept building on a decade of scientific research which utilizes imaging data more effectively. It takes advantage of the latest advancements in digitization and AI to analyze biologically relevant features that cannot be quantified manually to provide new insights into the tumor and its surrounding environment. This powerful platform can help researchers uncover novel biomarkers to eventually better inform doctor’s decisions about their patient’s care. And the best part is, Px is applied to images that are routinely available and don’t require any separate orders or changes to existing workflows.

DQR Expert
----------

Easy to use tool for organizing and analyzing quality assurance data for machined parts.Click to read more.DQR Expert provides a human readable interface for analyzing and comparing measurements of machined parts. Created for Turbo Machined Products in Frankfort, NY, DQR Expert allows Turbo's engineers to save time performing quality assurance checks on parts by making measurement reports much more easily readable and accessible, utilizing cloud architecture and modern technologies like gRPC and Kubernetes to ensure speed and reliability.

DQR Expert constantly monitors for new report files and pull information from them, storing the most pertinent details and then making them available to Turbo’s engineers in a simple and efficient user interface. Now, instead of spending time painstakingly searching through report files, opening and reading through each one, engineers can just look at the DQR Expert Pro UI and immediately find the most pertinent information, as well as create combined reports for easy high level analysis.

TR Customer Management Portal
-----------------------------

Web interface for managing customer data and a streamlined workflow for meeting customer needs, allowing TR employees to provide for their customers easily and effectively.Click to read more.Entrepeneur Noah Garrett chose us as partners to collaborate on a new software system to support their startup based in the automotive industry. Their ideal workflow required a set of components capable of receiving and processing unique information from customers; using AWS services such as Lambda, we custom\-built an easy to use management interface that allows employees to easily view customer data and create reports on the fly.

Customer data is stored securely in the cloud, protected by Amazon's Cognito user pool management and security service. Employees logged into the TR Management Portal can then access customer requests and create reports by filling out interactive forms, which are then sent to customers through whichever notfication methods they prefer.

Feedback Marketing Tool
-----------------------

Publish feedback you receive from your happy customers/clients with just one click. Automatically asks permission to use feedback received in an email/message \- if the recipient accepts, the feedback is published directly to social media of your choice.Click to read more.We designed and implemented a system to allow business owners and marketers to easily publish customer feedback to their websites or social media.

Upon receiving communication from a happy customer, a single click can allow a user to send a response asking the customer for permission to use their message as a testimonial publicly, and if the customer accepts their message will be formatted and published to any places the user has configured.

Compatible with the most popular social media sites including Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter and more, and can be directly integrated to email clients such as Outlook.

How we work
-----------


 For both B2B and B2C clients, we believe in a mindful approach where customer needs and business objectives align. Here’s what it means to design like you mean it.
 


 Stop 

 Think before you design 

 Creating products with lasting value starts with understanding your growth market and how customer needs align to business objectives. 


 Collab   
\-orate 

 Work cross\-functionally 

 You know your product and customers best. We’ll be your strategic partner committed to bringing your long\-term vision to life. 


 


 Listen 

 Research and test 

 Listen to your audience. We believe in testing early and often to mitigate risk, gain market fit, and create experiences that deeply resonate.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------


### What makes ChatHQ different from other engagement platforms?


What sets ChatHQ apart from other engagement platforms is its unique blend of customizable engagement tools, white\-label capabilities, and advanced analytics, all designed to provide a comprehensive solution for improving customer interactions and driving business growth.


### Does the Engagement Widget integrate with HighLevel?


 Yes it does! We have several integrations with HighLevel, and are building more every month! The current integrations include SMS chat, calendars, forms \& surveys, and reviews! We will soon have Livechat that flows directly into your HighLevel sub\-accounts as well.


### Can ChatHQ be white\-labeled?


 Yes, ChatHQ can be fully white\-labeled, allowing your business to offer a sophisticated engagement platform under your own branding. This feature is particularly beneficial for agencies and consultants looking to add value to their services.


### What types of businesses benefit the most from using ChatHQ?


 A wide range of businesses benefit from ChatHQ, including digital marketing agencies, SaaS startups, consultants, website design agencies, and small to local businesses. ChatHQ's versatile features are designed to meet diverse engagement and analytics needs across industries.


### How does ChatHQ improve lead generation?


ChatHQ enhances lead generation by leveraging advanced real\-time engagement tools and personalized interactions, coupled with deep analytics. This approach ensures every visitor interaction is optimized for conversion, significantly increasing lead capture rates.


### How can ChatHQ improve my sales process?


ChatHQ can significantly enhance your sales process by strategically engaging with prospects during crucial decision\-making moments, supported by analytics that pinpoint opportunities for optimization, leading to improved conversion rates and sales outcomes.


### Can ChatHQ help with customer retention?


 Yes, ChatHQ significantly boosts customer retention by providing enhanced support and creating personalized engagement opportunities. These interactions are tailored to meet customer needs and preferences, encouraging long\-term loyalty and satisfaction.


### How does ChatHQ simplify customer support?


ChatHQ simplifies customer support processes by offering advanced AI functionality, fully customizable knowledge bases, automated support tools, and comprehensive analytics. These features enable businesses to provide immediate, personalized assistance, understand customer needs better, and optimize support strategies based on data\-driven insights.


#### How does ChatHQ personalize customer interactions?


ChatHQ offers a feature called ""Dynamic Behavior Targeting"" that allows you to build interactions with visitors and users based on specific behavior and other criteria such as time, date, device, and much more. This data\-driven approach enables you to tailor conversations, offers, and support to meet individual customer needs, ensuring a more engaging and relevant experience for each user, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty, and making interactions more meaningful and effective.


### How does ChatHQ ensure user data privacy?


ChatHQ prioritizes user data privacy by adhering to the latest data protection regulations and employing state\-of\-the\-art security measures. This ensures all user data is handled with the utmost care and confidentiality.


### How long can I use my free Portal account?


 We have no intentions of removing the free portal plan. So you can rest assured that you can take full advantage of the free plan. If we ever make changes to our free plan, we will make sure to plan accordingly with all customers residing in the free tier.


### What happens if I don't own a HighLevel agency account?


 If you do not have access to the agency dashboard in a HighLevel, or you are on the $297/mo HighLevel subscription, you can still use the Engagement Widget and integrate it with HighLevel locations individually!   
   
Once you integrate a location, you'll be able to setup an Engagement Widget and Conversion Tools using things like sms webchat, forms, surveys, calendars, and reviews from that integrated location!


### How do I add ChatHQ to my website?


 Integrating ChatHQ with your website is straightforward; it involves embedding a simple code snippet into your website's HTML. This process is designed to be quick and easy, allowing you to start enhancing your site's engagement in no time.


### Can I bring my customers into the ChatHQ Portal and let them build their own widgets?


We do not recommend giving your customers access to the ChatHQ Portal because it is not white labeled, so your customers will see ChatHQ branding if they login.   
   
BUT, if you are subscribed to the AGENCY plan in ChatHQ ($297/mo), we give you the ability to embed a white labeled version of the ChatHQ Portal (The White Label Widget Builder) directly into your HighLevel account, which gives your customers access to building their own widgets without exposing ChatHQ or HighLevel branding!


### How frequently does ChatHQ update its features?


ChatHQ constantly evolves, ensuring its platform remains at the forefront of engagement technology by introducing new features and updates frequently to enhance user experience and functionality.


### What support does ChatHQ offer its users?


 ChatHQ's user support is comprehensive, offering extensive documentation, responsive live chat, and email support to ensure users can leverage the platform effectively and resolve any issues promptly.

[Clinician Sign In](https://provider.headlamp.com/)[Book a demo](https://calendly.com/headlamphealth/demo)Bringing greater precision to mental health care

Headlamp makes it easy for clinicians and their patients to access their universal medical records, while also providing advanced AI tools to support more personalized health insights and decision\-making

[Book a demo](https://calendly.com/headlamphealth/demo)Tools for clinicians
====================

A comprehensive dashboard that unites medical records with patient\-reported outcomes to enable data\-informed care
===================================================================================================================

The one\-size\-fits\-all paradigm is not working. Personalized psychiatry is coming, and clinicians need a full picture of their patients to build the right plan. Headlamp provides tools for clinicians to access more data on their patients while saving them time in documentation and treatment planning. With both clinician\- and patient\-interfacing products, Headlamp builds on the therapeutic alliance and unlocks more collaborative, patient\-centered care.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Whether it's intake or follow\-up appointments, I spend a lot of my time trying to tease out history and progress from my patients.  Headlamp not only helps fill in these gaps for me, but does it in a more efficient and objective way to supplement my patient interviews.""

Dr. Jason Tucciarone, MD, PhD, 

Stanford University Medical Center

![]()Access medical records with the click of a button
=================================================

Typically, psychiatry relies on self\-report data, which can be subjective and incomplete. Accessing a patient’s medical record can take time, and finding the relevant information hidden in pages and pages of documents is draining. Headlamp does the work for you, pulling history from our network of EHRs, cleaning the data, and presenting it in an easy\-to\-use dashboard. We also source history directly from the patient, filling in any gaps to ensure a more complete record.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Measurement\-based care, advanced to the next level
===================================================

Currently adopted patient\-reported rating scales are one way to track progress over time. But when it comes to understanding our patients better and informing care decisions, we need more granularity than a number can provide. Headlamp gets you all the details you and your patients need to chart a path forward.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![]()![]()AI tools built for clinicians
=============================

To save you time, HeadlampAI automatically summarizes patient health history, highlights key details, and generates documentation to give you more time with your patients.

[Get Started](https://dashboard.holdings.io/sign-up?referrer=%22https://holdings.io%22)![Arrow]()ANSWERS TOFrequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Will the yield change?![Down Chevron]()The yield rate is tightly aligned with the variable national rates set by the Federal Reserve, so it will change. We also offer higher yield based on the amount of deposits in your Holdings account. The more you deposit, the more you earn. See more on our [**pricing page**](/info/pricing).Does this mean I can close my other business bank accounts?![Down Chevron]()Holdings is designed to compliment your existing business bank accounts rather than replace them. Our aim is to provide a secure platform that helps you earn yield on funds that are not actively used in your day\-to\-day operations while ensuring high liquidity and same\-day accessibility.   
  
While Holdings offers an opportunity to earn yield on idle funds, we do not handle activities such as payroll, daily operating costs, or vendor payments. Instead, we focus on optimizing the returns on the sum of money that tends to sit idle in your account\- an amount you may feel should be working harder for you, especially as inflation rises.   
  
Think of us as a strategic partner that works alongside your operating bank accounts. We empower you to make the most of your funds that are not immediately needed, allowing you to earn yield without sacrificing liquidity.Why should I open another account?![Down Chevron]()Separating your funds offer many benefits other than earning yield. Here are a few:  
 * **Put idle money somewhere safe:** Money can only be moved out of this account to linked business bank accounts by teammates you have granted access. These measures limit the places your money can go, and the people who have access to it.
* **Diversify your institutional risk:** Today’s modern business needs to avoid risk by working with several institutions. When you open an account with us your funds are distributed between many institutions in our “sweep network” including Goldman Sachs, Capital One and Evolve.
* **Maintain flexibility:** Funds can be moved easily by same\-day ACH or wire transfer anytime you need them.
What is a sweep network? Where is my money and how safe is it?![Down Chevron]()A sweep network is a network of banks that come together to share deposits so that they all have more cash. The great part is, the banks are willing to pay for these deposits, and that’s how you make yield.   
  
**Where is my money?** We place your funds with our partner bank’s (Evolve Bank \& Trust) sweep program. This program distributes the deposits across a network of FDIC\-insured banks including Capital One, Evolve Bank \&Trust, and others.   
  
**How safe is my money?** We offer access to up to $5 million in FDIC Insurance—10x\* more than a regular checking account.   
  
To read more about the sweep program visit [**this website**](https://www.getevolved.com/openbanking/fdic-insured-sweep-program/fdic-program-bank-list/).   
  
\*10x is based off of the national deposit rate for savings on [FDIC.gov](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/).How secure is the Holdings platform?![Down Chevron]()Your security is our utmost priority. We implement stringent security measures to safeguard your data and assets—we use military\-grade encryption and end\-to\-end encryption for your private data stored on our platform. See our privacy policy for more details.What monthly statements do you provide?![Down Chevron]()We provide monthly statements in PDF form that are available in our platform that includes every money movement, yield paid, and relevant information.Who is Holdings?![Down Chevron]()Holdings is built by a team of seasoned operators and founders. We are dedicated to providing innovative software that simplifies and democratizes financial services, empowering businesses like yours to thrive.

            Here's How Vistaly Works Manage the entire Continuous Discovery process and keep stakeholders in the loop    ### First, find the right Outcomes

 Vistaly's KPI Trees makes it clear which leading indicators (i.e. customer behaviors) are *driving* business results, so you can set and and assign goals (Outcomes) to teams that you *know* will impact your bottom line.  ""Vistaly has empowered me to create comprehensive KPI Trees with my clients. The visual nature of the KPI Trees has significantly improved our ability to understand and communicate the context of their metrics, as well as act on these key performance indicators.""   ![]()

Communicate The ""Why"" Shows how each project improves the leading causes (Outcomes) that drive your bottom line             ### A note from Matt, our CEO

 
There is growing pressure on product teams to operate more effectively with less, ensuring that every investment returns value to the business. But this is at odds with how most teams measure their effectiveness. 

 
When product teams use speed to deliver as their guiding metric for innovation, they make a statement: *""We know exactly what to build, and it's better to prioritize how fast we get there over prioritizing how fast we learn and improve.""* 

 
At Vistaly, we believe speed to impact is the right guiding metric. Unfortunately, most tools are not designed with this in mind. We need better ways to continuously measure and learn how our work creates value for customers and translates that into returns for the business. When that’s hard to do, no wonder many teams resort to delivery speed as their guiding metric for measuring value.


 
We exist to support product teams prioritizing speed to impact when building solutions for their businesses and customers.

Matt O'Connell  

CEO, Vistaly

### Hitch a ride on an emerging trend

Process automation technology is exceptional today. We are lucky to live in a time where so many business activities can be automated. Just look around. Imagine what you could achieve if you didn't have to manage those task.  What big things would you achieve, what strategies would you pursue? 


 


ZD3 Group makes business better through automation. We give you the power and flexibility to do whatever needs doing — whether you’re running a startup, scale\-up, or global enterprise. 

##### Activities we automate

* Move files
* Query databases
* Recognize words on a page
* Perform calculations
* Type words
* Complete forms
* Apply payments
* Send emails
* other rule based business task
##### Benefits to business

* Allows you to focus on the big picture
* Do more with less
* Lower cost to complete task
* More consistent business operations
* Fewer mix\-ups and mistakes
* Add less head count as you grow
* Avoid employee burnout
* More predictable cost base
* Fewer business outages
### We will we will bot you

A ""bot"" is software that executes a routine task.  Here are some interesting differences between a bot and a regular worker:


​​


* A bot has a perfect memory and it never forgets anything.
* It executes only one task at a time. You can’t get a bot to do a super\-urgent task right now if it’s already busy doing something else. On the positive side, the bot will never mix anything up.
* It’s ready to work 24/7\. You can schedule night launches or ask bots to work on weekends, no problem.
* It boasts tremendous speed. When it comes to sequences of clicks, using console commands, typing, or data entry, bots are second to none.
* Bots can work either with people, called attended bots, or work independently, called unattended bots. The bot may automate the first step, the person may perform their task and then restart the bot which completes the remaining task.


​


Our team members are rock stars. We builds highly effective durable bots to make business better.  We operate in a $3B industry called Robotic\`Process Automation also known as RPA.  We love what we do and welcome the opportunity to automate for you. We hope you enjoy exploring our website and look forward to having fun while we make your business better.

“If it wasn’t for SquadTrip, I wouldn’t have been able to grow my group trips from 50 guests to 500\. Before, I was using spreadsheets, collecting money individually across a number of platforms.

GENERATION OF OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS
======================================

INTRODUCING A NEW ERA 
OF DATA HARVESTING \& ASSET TRACKING
===========================================================

[Get in touch](#contact-form-wrap)![WHY DISRUPTIVE]()01
==

WHY DISRUPTIVE
--------------


 Long story short: We transform STANDARD CAMERAS into high\-precision sensors. Today, cameras capture millions of pixels in one single frame, providing nearly endless possibilities for data extraction. We can do it all: simple object recognition and visualizations \- but also, and that’s the new and disruptive part, metric statutes, asset tracking/positioning, and even posture, and ergonomic analytics.
 ![WHY COST-EFFICIENT]()02
==

WHY COST\-EFFICIENT
-------------------


 We can integrate existing cameras rather than required to install new ones. Thanks to local processing and in the cloud, we turn your cameras into an extremely cost\-efficient sensor \- with only one interface/API. Our methodology offers significant cost advantages, compared to current tracking solutions based on sender\-receiver technologies like RFID or UWB.
 [Get in touch](#contact-form-wrap)WE TRANSFORM
STANDARD
CAMERAS
-----------------------------

... into high\-precision sensors to support data\-driven decision\-making and improvement initiatives without the need for expensive hardware sensors.\*for Gamification, IIOT, Industry 4\.0![WHY SUPERIOR]()03
==

WHY SUPERIOR
------------


 Superior is a big word, but we're proud to use it to describe our scientists from Silicon Valley to Scotland, who are clearly superior in computer vision, AI, and machine learning. The game changer? Leveraging this knowledge and developing an exclusive NEURAL NETWORK (International Patent) that enables the extraction of metric information (e.g. speed or distance) that surpasses all current computer vision capabilities.
 [Get more info](/en/#contact-form-wrap)![WHY ULTRA FAST [ROI]]()04
==

WHY ULTRA FAST \[ROI]
---------------------


 We maintain projects in Australia and New Zealand, but without setting foot in those countries, all of our visualisations are done remotely. New methods of data visualisation (Digital Spaghetti Maps or Dwelling Heat Maps) allow us to develop solutions for improvements very quickly without performing extensive data analysis.
Last but not least, our solutions show proven ROI with minimal cost/investment \- for a couple of months or even just a few weeks.
 SYNERGIZE: JOINING FORCES  FOR IMPACT

OpenObserve is a simple yet sophisticated log search, infrastructure monitoring, and APM solution. It is a full\-fledged observability platform that can reduce your storage costs by \~140x compared to other solutions and requires much lower resource utilization resulting in much lower cost.![<span class='highlight'>Logs, Metrics, Traces</span>]()Logs, Metrics, Traces
---------------------

### 

OpenObserve is an innovative open\-source observability platform designed to streamline the monitoring of logs, metrics, and traces. Thanks to its compatibility with storage services such as S3, GCS, Minio, and Azure Blob, OpenObserve significantly lowers storage costs \- reducing them to about 140 times less than Elasticsearch. Our platform stands out due to its stateless nodes architecture, a feature that ensures hassle\-free scaling. Its GUI is not only user\-friendly but also advanced, facilitating the management of various systems and various types of observability data. Think of it as an amalgamation of Prometheus for metrics, Elasticsearch for logs, Jaeger for traces, and Grafana for dashboards, all in one place. OpenObserve eliminates the need to master a new query language by supporting SQL as its primary query language. Additionally, we support PromQL for querying metrics data, extending its versatility. One of the standout features of OpenObserve is its built\-in alerting mechanism. This enables users to dispatch alerts to any platform, including but not limited to Slack and Teams. All this is wrapped in a package developed in Rust, ensuring high performance and memory safety. Join us at OpenObserve, where efficiency meets cost\-effectiveness.Logs, Metrics and Traces headingbottomLine

WHY FIX SECURITY?
-----------------

Detect, prioritize, and remediate critical cloud risks.

**Fix Security connects to cloud APIs to take full snapshots of your cloud infrastructure and technology stack.** You get a baseline inventory with a complete view of accounts, instances, functions, Kubernetes pods, databases, storage buckets, and all other resources and their configurations in a single place.

The Fix Security graph also shows relationships between resources, providing the context to understand critical risks and attack paths—so you can prioritize and fix the misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that matter.

CSPMMonitor CIS benchmarks, run compliance scans, and enforce policies. Build security intelligence on top of your inventory to stay in control and escalate critical risks.

InventoryGet a complete picture of your cloud and see what is running with visual maps. Fix Security discovers assets and collects rich configuration data for resources, no matter where, when, or how they were provisioned.

RemediationFix Security integrates with your workflow, ticketing, and messaging tools. Set up alerts and automations for policy violations to make it easy for your engineers to keep infrastructure updated and tidy.

--------------------------

What is Fix Security?**Fix Security is a** **CSPM** **tool.** **Fix Security performs routine compliance checks against snapshots of your infrastructure, identifies misconfigurations, and provides recommendations and workflows to correct detected issues.**

What is CSPM, and why is it necessary?**Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) helps maintain the security, compliance, and operational efficiency of your cloud infrastructure. Security and compliance are a shared responsibility between cloud providers and their customers:**

* **Security** ***of*** **the cloud:** Cloud providers are responsible for the underlying network and infrastructure.
* **Security** ***in*** **the cloud:** Customers are responsible for the data they store, access policies and regulatory compliance.

**Adherence to security and compliance policies determines a company’s security posture, and it is the customer’s responsibility to perform the necessary checks.** **CSPM** **standardizes and automates these checks.**

How does Fix Security work?**Fix Security creates snapshots of your infrastructure’s resource inventory at regular intervals. The data collection process is comparable to an** **ELT** **pipeline, a widely recognized approach in cloud security referred to as “agentless scanning.”**

* **Fix Collectors** harvest configuration data for each individual resource via cloud provider APIs and send this data to Fix Core.
* **Fix Core** stores metadata in a graph\-based inventory and provides APIs to query and update the graph.

**The graph contains a complete representation of all resources and their relationships. By combining security data with these connections, Fix Security identifies potential pathways to a security breach. This empowers security engineers to pinpoint critical risks in their infrastructure.**

What is included in a “snapshot” of my cloud?**A cloud snapshot is a complete representation of your cloud infrastructure that includes all components and configurations—compute instances, storage buckets, serverless functions, etc. Snapshots not only list resources, but also capture the relationships and connections between resources.**

**The significance of snapshots lies in their non\-invasive nature when it comes to conducting security assessments. With snapshots, you avoid direct interactions with your live production environment, minimizing any potential disruptions.**

Which cloud providers are supported?**Fix Security currently only supports** **AWS****, but we’re working on rolling out support for Kubernetes, Google Cloud, Azure, and DigitalOcean.**

How does Fix Security connect to my cloud?**Fix Security requires read\-only API access to the cloud accounts you wish to monitor and secure.**

**Manually maintaining these permissions is a tedious task, so we provide a CloudFormation template that automatically creates a role with the required permissions and a trust that allows a specified** **AWS** **account to assume this role.**

How does Fix Security ensure the security and compliance of its systems?**Fix Security is currently undergoing** [**SOC 2**](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2) **and** [**ISO**](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001)[**/**](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001)[**IEC**](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) [**27001**](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) **certifications to demonstrate our commitment to security and compliance best practices.**

How does Fix Security protect my data?* **Fix Security does not access the actual data stored on your storage volumes or buckets.** Fix Security operates without an agent, only reading the configuration data of your cloud resources via cloud provider APIs. This approach allows Fix Security to scan for and identify security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
* **Fix Security also utilizes an isolation concept known as workspaces to organize and secure your data.** When you create a Fix Security account, a workspace is created specifically for you. You have the option to invite others to join your workspace, but by default only the owner of a Fix Security workspace can view its data.
* **Additionally, Fix Security allocates a dedicated database for every workspace.** Data pertaining to your workspace is stored in a database exclusively for your use, rather than being commingled in a shared database with other Fix Security customer data. This architecture not only segregates customer data (enhancing privacy), but also mitigates a range of security vulnerabilities associated with shared databases, such as SQL injection attacks.
