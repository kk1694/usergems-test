What our customers are saying
-----------------------------

![]()""The customer support at Remofirst has been amazing — I love that our team has a dedicated account manager to help us with any things that come up for our remote team members, such as issuing work permits. I was looking for a simplified EOR service where I didn’t have to be so involved and could just pass our remote candidates along to be onboarded. Remofirst has made this experience very easy and personalized for us, and I am happy to be working with them to employ our team members in other countries.""Janice Kay Mamo \- Human Resources Manager @ Weavr ![]()""Remofirst allows us to compliantly hire and manage employees in countries where we don't have an entity, in a cost\-effective manner. This is helping Creatio scale its team worldwide and save time and costs while doing so! They had the best pricing of all the EORs we talked to, and the process of getting started was smooth even though we had a lot of questions. Their team is very kind and attentive in their support, and the platform has been easy to navigate. We just finished our onboarding and are excited to be working with Remofirst!""Olivia H \- Global HR Manager @ Creatio![]()""We had a candidate that we really wanted to hire, but she is in a different country, so we needed to use an EOR to make that happen safely and legally for both parties. Remofirst handled the contract and onboarding, and will now handle the payroll, making sure everything meets legal requirements. While their pricing is competitive, the real advantage of using Remofirst is their customer service and transparency. We were completely new to the world of EOR, and we had a specific person we wanted to hire, in a pretty short timeframe...but they happened to be in another country. Our Account Executive was helpful, responsive, and patient with our many questions, and offered us competitive pricing. Then the Customer Service Team got us all set up and ready to go with a quick turnaround.""Kelly R \- Math Made Visible   
![]()""Remofirst has helped us expand our team globally while managing the complicated tasks like termination processes in different countries. Their customer support is available at any time of day and always remind us when our contracts need to be updated. I can’t imagine what my life would be like without Remofirst.""Anna Tylechkina \- Talent Acquisition Specialist @ Makini![]()""Remofirst allows me to be employed remotely and be compliant in the country where I live. It is also super helpful when submitting and managing expenses. Altogether, it is an excellent addition to the main HR platform I use with its admin capabilities.I like how simple and intuitive the platform is. The navigation is clear, and the functionality is more than adequate, though. Getting things done on the platform is straightforward.""Martin P \- Head of Marketing @ BetVictor![]()""Remofirst’s pricing stood out to me among competitors, along with their 24\-hour support, which is important when you’re hiring people around the world. Their platform has been easy to use and our onboardings have been smooth. I would definitely recommend using Remofirst as your EOR for any global hires.""Kaniyet Rayev \- Co\-founder and CEO @ AppboxoVisa support in 85\+ countries

Building the Decentralized Future
=================================

Edge \& Node is the initial team behind The Graph. We create and support protocols and dapps that empower individuals and move humanity forward.

![]()![]()![]()Recognizing the past
--------------------

Modern society has evolved over the past two hundred years around Industrial Age institutions. Banks, Corporations, Universities, and Governments have been the predominent means of scaling human coordination. Capitalism has created a tremendous amount of wealth around the world but institutions have not been able to keep up with the rate of change brought on by the internet.

![]()Decentralized Systems
---------------------

Protocols are internet native institutions that are open and transparent, and can be used to coordinate large numbers of people. With web3, we can rethink what it means to be an effective individual in the Internet Age. How we spend our time, what we value, the way we distribute resources, the big audacious goals we take on—it’s all up for grabs. This is our time to dream big, work hard, and create the future we want to live in.

![]()Our Work

### The Graph

An indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data and making it easily accessible.

What Google does for the web, The Graph does for blockchains. A decentralized network ensures that open data is always available and easy to access. The Graph is used by thousands of protocols and dapps like Uniswap, Synthetix, Aave, Balancer, Zora, Foundation, and more.

Edge \& Node is a team of creators, builders and visionaries accelerating the future at lightspeed. Together, we turn ambitious ideas into tangible reality, breaking through the internet's perceived limitations to reveal abundant opportunity.

----------------------

Brands replace coupons in their welcome series popup, email, \& SMS with CashBack. Shoppers may redeem CashBack post purchase either as cash via a Visa card or a gift card back to the brand's store.  
  
Since not every shopper claims their CashBack brands reinvest that money into larger offers to increase conversion and revenue.

### The Three Cues to Providing Effective Elderly Care and Fostering Independence

[Learn More!](https://www.ait.care)![]()The aging population is growing at an unprecedented rate, with millions of individuals now needing continuous care. This demographic shift is creating a significant strain on the healthcare system and increasing the demand for effective elderly care solutions. 


 


The market for elderly care is expanding rapidly, driven by the rising need for comprehensive support for aging individuals. However, there is a severe shortage of caregivers, compounded by a shrinking middle\-aged population available to provide care. The cost of quality care continues to rise, making it inaccessible for many. This shortage not only impacts the well\-being of the elderly but also places immense pressure on families and healthcare providers. 

### P R O B L E M

Our Goals
=========

Our approach is centered around three main cues: visual, auditory, and verbal, which are crucial for comprehensive elderly care.

01

Visual
------

AITCare prioritizes the visual monitoring of daily activities, cognitive health, and sleep to ensure safety and well\-being. By using advanced technologies to track movements, detect falls, and monitor overall health, we aim to provide peace of mind to both the elderly and their families.

![Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 9.18.00 PM.png]()[Learn More!](https://www.ait.care/about-5)![Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 9.21_edited.jpg]()02

Auditory
--------

Understanding the needs and concerns of the elderly is essential for providing personalized care. Our tools help in identifying changes in behavior and health conditions, ensuring timely interventions and support. By actively listening, we aim to create a responsive and supportive care environment.

[Learn More!](https://www.ait.care/about-5)03

Verbal
------

Communication is vital for mental and emotional health. Our solutions focus on facilitating meaningful conversations, detecting changes in communication patterns, and predicting cognitive function. This helps maintain cognitive health and keeps the elderly engaged and connected with their loved ones.

![Screenshot 2024-06-27 at 2.02.08 PM.png]()[Learn More!](https://www.ait.care/about-5)Through these cues, AITCare is committed to offering holistic and innovative solutions that promote independent living and enhance the overall quality of life for the elderly.


###### Vijai B, CEO@Ocean View

AITCare is a great monitoring system to enhance our patients' care.   It's a very easy platform for our caregivers to use and the end result is providing the highest quality care.


###### Matt B, Founder@Wearme

Great product concept and hardware config with privacy in mind.


###### Mahesh N, MD@SeniorLiving

I must say AITCare is a very innovative product which will help monitor these critical issues with Seniors and provide valuable information and data to their families and Physicians .


###### Nait K, Agent@NewYorkLife

I appreciate the emphasis on fall prevention rather than solely detecting and reporting falls. It's great that AITCare give due importance to detection because timely intervention can and save countless lives.


###### Mick F, Ambassador@Aging2\.0

​There is no doubt that Intelligent computer vision will be crucial in automating at home care.  Edge processed ICV is inherently secure and private and will empower independence and self\-care.

Jul 2, 2024### Introducing Superblocks Multi\-Page Apps: Build complex enterprise admin suites

Most enterprises depend on comprehensive, multi\-functional administrative suites to support their internal workflows and critical business operations. For example, a payments\-focused FinTech company might want a single application for support and ops teams to handle customer onboarding operations, underwrite customers, manage transactions, and respond to support requests.‍These applications typically span many pages, each serving distinct operational workflows and teams. This segmentation enhances user experience and productivity, but often results in increased maintenance burden as the application continues to grow.‍Although businesses often look to low\-code to accelerate the development of internal tools and reduce maintenance burden, these platforms are often designed for building single\-purpose applications. Consequently, end users often have to switch between different tools, limiting their ability to serve customers efficiently and effectively. ‍

May 8, 2024### Introducing Superblocks Layouts: Build responsive, consistent, and pixel\-perfect UIs with zero frontend experience

Creating these dynamic experiences DIY requires front\-end developers to leverage complex, often difficult\-to\-use layout modes such as CSS Grid and Flexbox. While low\-code development platforms offer more simplicity via drag\-and\-drop application builders, these tools are often limited to building static, inflexible interfaces.

[![]()How do I deposit funds in my Cashmere wallet?](#)In your preferred wallet or exchange, you can input the Vault Address displayed in the top right of the dashboard and send funds accordingly. You can hit the copy button to add it to your clipboard.  
‍  
If you’re depositing for the first time, the Cashmere wallet may not be identified by some platforms as a valid address, for your own safety. In this case, use our UI to (1\) connect your browser\-friendly wallet, (2\) click our **Deposit** button, and (3\) input how much of which token you want to deposit and then hit **Submit**.

[![]()What is an ATA or why do I have to make an Associated Token Account?](#)For each token contained in a wallet, there exists a distinct token account associated with each mint. This means that with x different types of tokens, there exists x different token accounts. If you are sending tokens to yourself or another recipient, you may be depositing a token into that wallet for the first time so there does not exist a compatible account. In that case, you will need to create the associated token account on behalf of the user for the token transfer to succeed.

[![]()Why is the address in the URL different from the vault address on my dashboard?](#)The address in the URL is an internal multisig identifier that you don't need to be concerned with. If you are depositing funds, please use the Vault Address shown in the dashboard top right with the copy button or deposit using our Deposit interface. This can be a point of confusion but we're working towards simplifying the url to make things clearer.

[![]()How do I send funds from my Cashmere wallet?](#)There are a couple ways to reach the transfer page for a token. In the main Assets page, you can click **Transfer** under any of the tokens or you can click the **Send** button in the upper right. Simply input the wallet address you want to send tokens to and fill out the transaction info.

[![]()How to do I view my deposits?](#)Currently, to view the deposit history for your Cashmere multisig wallet, navigate to the Transactions page and click on the Solscan or Solana Explorer link. To view the aggregate of your deposits and transactions, you can simply go to your Assets page. If your deposit is not showing up, make sure (1\) you sent the tokens to the Vault Address in the top right of the dashboard, (2\) for developers your wallet is connected to mainnet, or (3\) wait a few min before worrying to see if the transaction was slow and then message us on Discord for further support.

[![]()I'm having issues, what do I do?](#)Please reach out to us on our Discord and report bugs or any issues you’re having! We’d love to help. You can also reach out to us on Twitter if you'd prefer.

[![]()Who founded the company?](#)Fully doxxed, Charlotte McGinn and Shashank Khanna. You can easily reach us on LinkedIn or through our Cashmere Twitter.

 I have used all the calendar scheduling apps and [cal.com](https://cal.com) is the easiest, most intuitive, and best out of all of them. They actually listen to user concerns and address them, and their speed of shipping new versions and features is second to none. The integrations they have are also massively powerful.

Would highly recommend!   Apr 5, 2023    ![Ben avatar]()  Ben @supaml  [![product_hunt]()](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cal-com)   Amazing. I've been sharing it with everyone I know. It's helped me create more events spontaneously, because of how smooth it is compared to Calendly and Harmonizely.   Oct 22, 2023    ![davidvkimball avatar]()  davidvkimball      ### By far the best calendar/scheduling app ever

 Without a doubt the best calendar/scheduling application I have ever used. It has all of the advanced features I need while also being insanely intuitive and straightforward for both end\-users and booking recipients. Love it!!

 What an amazing support experience! Identified a small bug and sent them an e\-mail. The bug was fixed (Github pull request as a proof!) in under 24 hours. I've never seen such a fast and efficient support before, call me impressed!   Mar 21, 2023    ![Kent C. Dodds 🌌 avatar]()  Kent C.

I'm liking it so far. I wasn't particularly displeased with calendly. It's fine. But I like that cal is OSS and my sub to calendly was coming up for renewal so I thought I'd check it out.

---------------------------------

Enkrypt AI’s platform provides testing and compliance reports that directly map to global security frameworks including OWASP Top 10 for LLMs, NIST, and MITRE ATLAS.

![OWASP AI security logo]()OWASP Top 10 for LLMs defines the most critical vulnerabilities often seen in LLM applications, highlighting their potential impact, ease of exploitation, and prevalence in real\-world applications.

![NIST AI security logo]()NIST’s ARIA program attempts to establish guidelines on large language model (LLM) risks. ARIA evaluations will use proxies for application types, risks, tasks, and guardrails.

![MITR ATLAS AI security logo]()MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial\-Intelligence Systems) raises awareness of the rapidly evolving vulnerabilities of Al\-enabled systems as they extend beyond cyber.

[Get Started](./treatments/)Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

More questions and answers on our [FAQ page](./faq/)

What is Henry?

Henry is a healthcare subscription service that provides our clients with access to high\-quality practitioners with a focus in holistic care for endocrine conditions for a fixed monthly\-price.

Who can use Henry?

Henry is open to everyone regardless of gender. To use Henry you must be:

1\) 18 years old or older.
2\) Have a demonstrated medical need for treatment.
3\) Be a resident or physically in one of the states we provide services to.

How does it work?

Henry is designed to be more than a telehealth platform, but still simple for our clients. You can start treatment in three easy\-steps.

1\) Complete a medical intake and (if necessary) have lab work done to verify a medical need for treatment.
2\) Speak to your new healthcare provider through a telehealth (audio\-visual) appointment.
3\) If medically appropriate, receive your medication in the mail every 30\-days, or 60\-days, or 90\-days from a mail order pharmacy provider (depending on your provider’s decision).

We want to enable you to form a long\-term connection with Henry so that we can provide ongoing care for your specific condition. With that in mind, Henry is designed for patients seeking long\-term care.

How do I see a provider?

After completing your medical intake forms our team will schedule your telehealth appointment with your provider. Your provider will complete a 2\-way audiovisual (telehealth) appointment with you on Doxy, a HIPAA compliant telehealth system.

Essentially you will have a video call with the provider.

Does Henry require a long\-term contract?

No. Henry is offered on a month\-to\-month basis. We do not require you to sign up for any specific length of time.

#### Connected


A wide range of detailed integrations with major brokers as well as regional and local brokers and funding sources across the country.


![x]() 


#### Reliable


A focus on uptime availability and handling of offline operation when networks fail outside of our control, including outages from mobile networks and internet service providers.

#### Intuitive


A clean and modern feel so dispatching and scheduling is made easy.


 


##### Intuitive Dispatching \& Scheduling


A clean and modern look and feel so handling tasks for dispatching and scheduling is easy. We believe in the value of automation, but we also believe strongly of the need for a human touch in order to provide quality NEMT services. This is why we focus on providing the tools to allow dispatchers and other operators to make the right decisions quickly and efficiently.


##### Native Mobile Apps


You won’t find any gimmicks here! With actual mobile apps for iOS and Android, you’ll enjoy lower data\-consumption, as well as a consolidated solution that offers “lite” tools for mobile dispatchers \& management. This includes providing you with the options on who (ie drivers and/or dispatchers) can use the mobile app to see your fleet vehicle locations, and more.


##### We use Google Maps API


It has become common among many of our our competitors to avoid or move away from integration with the Google Maps API’s due to cost. Mobility Route is committed to providing the best mapping and traffic model information in our solutions, greatly impacting our customers performance, especially in urban areas.


##### Partners \& Integrations


We are staying on the leading edge of innovation and collaboration within the NEMT space. We provide and maintain both API integration and file\-based processes with many national, regional, and even local brokers and programs across the country. We also support other integrations with our partners and other popular software solutions used to handle your daily business.


##### HIPAA Compliance a Top Priority


Many stakeholders in the NEMT industry have come to realize the seriousness of compliance with HIPAA. NEMT operators must ensure they comply with various aspects of this law. Unfortunately its not just as simple as sending drivers through so\-called “HIPAA training” and thinking it only applies to medical information. Any personal identifiable information– even addresses and full names– is subject to protection under the law.


 


###### WHAT WE HAVE


Features made for NEMT
----------------------


 Our solution has always been focused on attention to detail in order to avoid a cookie\-cutter solution seen in most other NEMT software platforms. 


[Take a tour](#) 


###### RETURN ON INVESTMENT


Ensuring transparency \& fairness
---------------------------------


 We believe in being fair and transparent in our pricing as well as our costs of doing business. Ensuring a return\-on\-investment for both our companies in difficult industry is key to a thriving relationship.

##### Muralidharan Sundarajan
 Former head of procurement


![]()


![]()  Post Covid, geo\-political turmoil and looming recession
 have increased the complexity and expectations of CPO or
 Procurement function at large \- with high visibility at CEO and
 board levels \- as procurement function have become more
 strategic.  
  

 Apart from Right Product, Right Price and Right Quantity,
 ensuring the Right Value is becoming critical for companies.
 Companies need to invest in next\-gen procurement technologies to
 bring in analytics/ visualization, predictive analytics,
 deployment of RPA for recurring or transactional activities with
 AI / Cognitive capabilities.. these are not buzz words
 anymore.  
  

 With the number of ""recurring"" purchases, the transactional
 volumes have gone up significantly and effective solutions are
 required to help with both transactional as well as strategic
 part of procurement.  
  

 I am excited about the approach Krayo is taking to solve the
 problem. As a procurement practitioner, I love the fact that
 they look at Corp Spend holistically from a procurement lens
 which is more strategic than transactional. Done right, this
 could be transformational for companies.

##### Ross Tennenbaum
 CFO

![]()  The ability to access data\-based benchmarks is critical
 for any finance professional. Today, these benchmarks are often
 not readily available, requiring me to resort to informal
 information checks sourced manually through my network. To have
 a curated, more real\-time benchmark feed would be game\-changing
 and I would pay for that service in a heartbeat.

##### Vijay A MFinance


![]()


![]()  Today most companies have signed up for a long list of
 SaaS/software vendors. During sign up the contracts are primed
 for maximum usage to get best discounts, rates etc. Over the
 years the actual usage of the SaaS products forms a very small
 portion of the contracted capacity.  
  

 I have seen cases where 300 employees were issued a subscription
 for a product and less than 50 of them had logged into the
 product in a year and only 10 were regular users. For a
 Finance/Commercials team it is difficult to realize who are
 using various subscriptions if we are paying more than what we
 are using for. Complicating the matters further, most SaaS
 billings are auto\-charged to credit cards or are renewed
 annually there by cutting out the review mechanism from the
 payment for the product.  
  

 This is where a product like Krayo can play a key role by
 bringing together all spends and linking it to the usage across
 the organization.  
  

 The data comes from Krayo is independent from the vendor or
 end\-user team, both of which usually do not provide usage data
 to finance easily.

##### Vivek SingalCo\-founder


![]()


![]()  As we were growing, adoption of technology and tools
 became a natural choice for us in various aspects of running
 business. And thanks to multiple providers which made this
 really possible for me, be it in the field of development, HR,
 finance, sales etc. you think of it and the tool exists with
 more than a dozen provider. But eventually it became a challenge
 for me to manage so many vendors, track billing, track usage
 within organisation and justify using the services. The more I
 think, the larger the problem occurs to me. And then I
 encountered Krayo and it’s founder who had just picked a piece
 from my mind and were working on it. And this is just an initial
 part of their broader platform story.  
  

 I would describe Krayo as a great productivity tool that uses AI
 to bring real time decision making at one's fingertips.
 Technology driven integrations provides deeper understanding of
 diverse data sets. I am waiting for full blown versions of Krayo
 to come out.

##### Vikas Gupta
 Procurement Head


![]()


![]()  At Innovaccer, we manage a broad swathe of requests
 across functions and regions (US, UAE, INDIA), and keeping pace
 with the business groups is always a priority. Needless to say,
 Procurement needs to cut across other support functions i.e.,
 Finance, Legal, IT, and Compliance, in order to fulfill these
 requisitions.  
  

 At times it becomes hard for us to drive visibility across the
 teams on the process and serve the BUs to the best of our
 abilities. Krayo brings in a lot of promise to completely turn
 things around for us. A single platform for Corp Spend sounds
 like a dream which I really wish to see as a reality soon.  

 From full cross\-functional visibility to defining the policies
 we want and getting its compliance; from parallel workflows to
 automated reports and analytics; there's just a lot to look
 forward to and embrace. This is the future of Corporate
 Spend.

              Real Results with Roadmap
-------------------------

          ""The RoadmapX cohort gave me the proper tools to be more confident in my job search. It helped me change my mindset and realize that I’m far more capable than I previously thought I was."" 

   ##### Adua A

           ""My experience with RoadmapX was transformative. I had been struggling with a job search since deciding to go back to a company after doing freelance consulting for several years. RoadmapX helped me to\-\- \- Figure out how to best position my experience to lead to the type of job that I wanted."" 

   ##### Veronica F

           ""The approach at Roadmap is vastly different \-\- and far more useful \-\- than other job search support. The real way to get a job is not by writing a resume or preparing for specific interview questions but by the real connections you make in the industry. Unlike other systems, Roadmap helps you meet new people at the companies where you want to work and feel good about yourself and confident in your interviews."" 

   ##### Kiki J

           ""I’m really grateful for the RoadmapX cohort because of the blueprints it gave me for things like a networking blurb and elevator pitch. I didn’t have those prior nor did I realize how important they were. I learned how to talk about my accomplishments on my resume and in interviews which was crucial since I was switching industries."" 

   ##### Carla W

           ""It has helped me improve my networking skills, I have been managing to network more with professionals and find clarity to what I want to do in my next position. I also learned what I was doing wrong in my job search. I am able to read job requirements now and not disqualify myself too quickly."" 

   ##### Rendani S

           ""Roadmap gave me the confidence I needed going into interviews. Malinda, the rest of the staff, and my cohort were instrumental in helping me identify my key results and really sell them to interviewers. Once I had an offer, I more than doubled my previous salary!"" 

   ##### Elisha A

           ""I was looking to transition from a project management role in the non\-profit space to a People Operations role in the tech industry. RoadmapX helped me identify my transferrable skills, provided professional connections, and shared constructive feedback on my interviewing skills. This combination of practice and connections helped open the doors for me to step into my current role as the People Operations Administrator \[in] tech."" 

   ##### Jordan R

           ""Roadmap helped me tell my story and land a job that's not only mission\-aligned but also pays 50% more than my last role. I gained the confidence to negotiate for the salary, sign\-on bonus, and title I wanted. It's all Up from here!"" 

   ##### Evelyn V

           ""RoadmapX helped me by providing invaluable networking tactics, a peer community with whom I could find support, and by offering opportunities to put the shine on both written and verbal facets of my application process. The strategies we discussed also helped me garner a significant pay increase.""

     ‹›    Get Answers to common Job Search Questions
------------------------------------------

Why didn't I land the job when I cold applied?Cold applying to jobs is one of the least effective ways to land a job. Landing a job through a referral is 4x more effective. Referrals have a 28\.5% chance of landing the job, while non\-referrals only have a 2\.7% chance. 

To leverage your odds of landing a job, start networking. Check out our Job Search ToolKit to find templates and steps to take to land networking calls and convert them into job referrals.

I got a referral but I didn't land the interview. What happened?Congratulations on landing a referral for a job interview! Keep landing referrals and you will meet with success. 

Job Search is a process and a numbers game. We recommend you land 2 referrals in order to land 1 phone screen interview, and ideally you'll land 10 referrals so that you can land 5 phone screen interviews. A couple of points to consider when securing a referral:

The strongest referral is from a contact who speaks directly to the hiring manager or leader at the company about you, and shares your resume and a brief blurb about why they think you are a good fit. Do yourself a favor and email your resume and blurb to your contact so that they can forward it directly to the hiring manager.

The second strongest is a direct referral to a recruiter, again with your blurb and resume.

The weakest referral is when you or your contact submit the referral through the application system. 

Check out the Job Search ToolKit for templates to write your best resume and networking blurb to make a strong referral.

I made it to the phone screen interview then I got rejected. What happpened?Congratulations on making it to the phone screen! If you didn't move forward it's likely because you need:

\- A strong elevator pitch where you
\- Relate key results from your career directly to the job description
\- Ask a genuine question at the end of the interview that will help you learn about the job, the company, and build a relationship with the recruiter

Keep in mind that Job Search is a process. We recommend landing 5 phone screen interviews in order to move forward in the process and land a job offer.

Head to the Job Search ToolKit to master your elevator pitch, key results, and telling stories during interviews so that you can start acing your phone screen interviews.

I made it to the Hiring Manager Round and got rejected. What happened?Congratulations on making it to the Hiring Manager round! If you didn't move forward it's likely because you need:

\- A strong elevator pitch customized to the Hiring Manager
\- To show a genuine desire to learn about the role
\- Tell stories that lead with key results
\- Do your three points of research on the Hiring Manager to build a relationship

Keep in mind Job Search is a process. We recommend landing at least 3 Hiring Manager interviews in order to move forward in the process and land a job offer.

Head to the Job Search ToolKit to master your elevator pitch, key results, and telling stories during interviews, and how to research your Hiring Manager.

I made it the team round and got rejected. What happened?Congratulations on making it to the team round! If you didn't move forward it's likely because you need:

\- To do your 3 key points of research for each person you interview with
\- Tell stories that lead with key results
\- Share information that actively builds a relationship with the person in front of you; if it doesn't build a relationships, don't say it
\- Use the Unknowns\-Assumptions\-Trad\-offs framework for scenario questions

Again, Job Search is a process. We recommend you make it to the team round with 3 companies to land the offer. Head to the Job Search ToolKit to master the team round.

I made it the final round and got rejected. What happened?Congratulations on making it to the final round! If you didn't move forward it's likely because you need:

\- To use the Fail\-Success\-Offer Criteria framework. Most companies move two candidates to the final round. Make sure throughout the process you are doing what it takes to fall into ""offer criteria"" and not just ""success criteria""
\- Build a vision for your role throughout the interview process
\- Build a relationship with the interviewer in the final round by showing up as the person ready to do the job, versus the person applying for the job

Again, Job Search is a process. We recommend you make it to the final round with 2 companies to land the offer. Head to the Job Search ToolKit to master final round interviews.

![]()We use Pyrra for cutting\-edge academic research on trends in disinformation and online extremism. The user\-friendly interface, sophisticated AI\-powered search tools, and tailored customer support enables my students to sift through vast amounts of social media information, extracting invaluable insights.

*Professor,* *Yale*

![]()Pyrra has better, more far\-reaching content than any other competitor.

*Senior Intelligence Analyst,* *Crisis Management Company*

![]()Pyrra is an incredibly unique platform that fills a much\-needed gap. Right now companies around the world are scrambling to ensure they stay ahead of threats and reputational risks that surface in platforms that are often missed by other social media monitoring companies \- an issue that Pyrra is built to address. By scanning platforms where extremists of all persuasions gather, Pyrra gives private companies the confidence that they are staying ahead of the curve and capturing threats that might otherwise fall through the cracks.

*Intelligence Manager,* *major US financial institution*

![]()In the first week of using it, the Pyrra platform alerted us to new spaces our opposition was operating in, gave us an easy framework for doing our daily information sweeps, and provided a birds eye view of several topics that warranted further research and reframing for our media partners. It is an incredibly valuable tool that saves our team a tremendous amount of time scanning for information, and is run by one of the most helpful teams I have ever encountered

*Managing Director,* *US NGO*

![]()Pyrra has been a valuable resource for us as we track and expose how extremist groups and individuals organize online. One of the best things about using Pyrra is that it frees us up from having to worry about the tedious details of collecting the data and instead we can focus on analyzing it and turning it into actionable intelligence

*Deputy Director,* *US NGO*

![]()Pyrra provides integration from multiple platforms and therefore enables the ability to see narrative transmission and trends across platforms and communities. It is a much better gauge of online content/discussions than analysis based only on larger platforms

*US Government official*

![]()Pyrra is a fantastic tool that increases access and drives analytics. This tool increases our productivity by at least 50%. The difference in what we can do with Pyrra versus manually is exponential.

#### Why Robotic Process Automation?

 


Robotic process automation will enable you to take your business to the next level with less manual effort, increased productivity and quality. When you implement automation into your day\-to\-day tasks, you can drastically increase productivity rates with less stress and frustration amongst your team members. It also reduces the risk of manual error, enhances security, and allows you to provide better customer service experiences. RPA is precisely what your business needs to grow and thrive over the years.

If you’d like to offer better quality while boosting morale and experiencing more productivity in the workplace, implementing RPA is a must. No matter what industry you’re in, there’s a high probability that automation will work in your favor, leading to better results that help you get ahead of your competition and continue to excel, even throughout some of the most challenging economic times.

Our philosophy is one of drip innovation, which is a grassroots driven exercise to identify the best ideas from all areas of business operations, however small or big.

Our transparent organization prioritizes automation and helps other organizations do the same seamlessly and without the stress.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

 


What is Drip Innovation by Outamation™?

Outamation Inc prides itself on its emphasis on what we call “drip innovation”. Inspired by drip irrigation, a method to get water directly to the root zone of plants, limiting evaporation while spurring more efficient growth, we seek to incorporate specific changes on a smaller scale to improve the overall performance of your business.

It is important to us that we use business’ investments in the most efficient way and bring our solutions directly to the “root zone” of your business problems. Most consultants seek to incorporate flashy and expensive ideas that cost much more relative to their benefits; even though they might look nice, we strive to take a more delicate approach, offering multiple small\-scale ideas that will focus on your pain points to solve operational and business challenges. Collectively, these smaller innovations lead to a larger return on investment.

For example, if we can automate several tasks that took a couple minutes of work to complete, the time saved will compound and lead to greater benefits than if we had just focused on one issue.

The drip innovation approach leads to operations teams cutting nonvalue tasks and automating repetitive tasks. In large and growing companies that are mired with bureaucratic steps, Outamation can take a surgical approach to spur growth and cut costs. This is often seen as a confidence booster to teams in a business that feel ignored by development projects that solely focus on big ticket items. Another key tenet of our approach is its lack of disruption on a grand scale, avoiding the danger of broad changes cannibalizing revenues. Outamation does not fear disruption or large changes, but rather seeks to make smart investments starting small to remove inefficiencies and then balancing them out with strategic changes to boost profits.


What is RPA?

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that enables businesses to use software robots to automate specific tasks.

**For e.g.** when applications are not integrated, team members copy paste or type data to do specific processing steps. These tasks can be either completely automated or augment the productivity of the processor by automating cookie cutter tasks, allowing them to focus on just exceptions.


What Processes Suit RPA Automation the Best?

RPA has wide ranging use across any industry or vertical which is based on computer driven processing – either online or client/server application.

**Typical characteristics of ideal candidate for RPA are:**

1. Processes which are not automated of course or not on the roadmap with the technology teams.
2. Processes which are regular and repetitive. These actions don’t change over time and remain constant. Because robots adhere to rules, tasks that are intended for automation should be composed of clear\-cut actions that are carried out consistently. One example is data entry and exception handling, “if this, do that”, rules\-based tasks like online filing of documents, naming conventions, auto responses etc.

Assuming 1 and 2 is met, second important criterion is to choose a process which has high number of transactions to justify the one time effort in setting up RPA and purchasing related licenses.


Can RPA be used in any Software Application?

RPA can automate and integrate data in any application, in any interface, and in any server, including Citrix, and is completely agnostic in this regard.


What are the benefits of RPA for my business?

Robotic process automation offers countless benefits to businesses throughout various industries.

**For example,** you can automate tasks generally completed by humans to drastically reduce the risk of errors occurring during the process. In addition, robotic process automation means getting time\-consuming, tedious tasks completed without stress or frustration.

While improving accuracy and boosting productivity are two good reasons to consider RPA for your infrastructure, those aren’t the only benefits your business can experience when implementing it into daily operations.

RPA will help you ramp up security, improve the experience customers have when dealing with your business, and help you maintain regulatory compliance to avoid potential legal issues. With benefits like these, it’s never been a better time to begin using RPA for your business.


How long does it take for process automation to be implemented?

The time it takes to implement RPA tools into your organization’s infrastructure may vary based on several factors. In some instances, it can take a minimum of two weeks. However, not all scenarios are the same. Some of the most challenging workflows can take up to three months to fully implement robotic process automation. Even if it takes more time to implement, it’s worth it in the long run because it will save your business much more time, effort, and money.


How do I get started with RPA?

Like anything, best step is taking the first step and [contact us](https://outamation.com/contact/) for a free consultation. We bring deep expertise from domain knowledge in specific industries, methodology to do cost effective RPA development and proven strategy to launch. Here are the basic steps –
1. Select a good process candidate for RPA
2. Document key steps and establish success criterion. Goal can be 70%\+ automation.
3. Set a pilot project with us to see benefits in real time
4. Plan the automation roadmap and Governance Plan
5. Continuous improvements

?


#### How do you guarantee the security of customer data?


 Most hardware on our platform is now hosted in certified data centers.
 But as an additional layer of security, we revoke SSH access from
 our hosts so they cannot access customer data without our knowledge.
   
  

 TensorDock background check all employees and restricts hostnode
 access to only those who need it. We have an agent monitoring
 hostnodes for logins and suspicious activity, from any source.

?


#### How does billing work?


 We operate on a pay as you go model. Users deposit funds,
 and we deduct balance continuously after a server is
 deployed. When your balance reaches $0, your servers are
 automatically deleted. If you need to rent servers long\-term,
 [reach out](/contact.html) to discuss our reserved
 pricing.
 


?


#### Why does the same GPU/CPU have multiple prices?


 We're a marketplace of independent hosts who compete and set
 their own pricing. As the customer, this ensures you
 always have access to the market's best pricing.   
  

 
 Additionally, hosts have different locations and redundancy, 
 leading to varying costs. Our marketplace offers you options to
 pay based on your preferences.

The Universal Entrypoint to Crypto
----------------------------------

The crypto industry is rapidly innovating, growing, and expanding. New blockchains and layers on top of those blockchains pop up every day, making the industry more and more complicated for developers and users.  
  
Universal Apps built on ZetaChain connect to anything in the crypto ecosystem, giving you simple, seamless, and secure access to all of crypto, as if it were all in a single place.

[Explore the ecosystem →](https://zetachain.com/docs/)Ecosystem Partners
------------------

Explore ZetaChain's growing ecosystem of diverse apps and partners across DeFi, Infrastructure, Wallets, Social, and beyond. See who is building with ZetaChain towards a future of connected crypto.

----------------------------

For app developers, choosing a blockchain ecosystem can feel daunting. With ZetaChain, you can rest easy knowing that your apps have universal access to any blockchain. With the Universal EVM, you can deploy your code once and future\-proof your applications.

[Start building →](https://zetachain.com/docs/)### Seamless entry for consumers

Access and interact with all of your assets, data, and the web3 ecosystem without needing to manage multiple wallets.

### One\-stop shop for developers

ZetaChain enables devs to build and deploy apps that work across all chains, from a single place.

### Minimized risk for your assets

Universal Apps have straightforward logic in a single place and settle assets on their native chains, so users can rest easier.

Introducing the Chain Abstraction Framework (CAF)
-------------------------------------------------

### Universal Chain Abstraction

Users no longer focus on choice of blockchain, as ZetaChain’s Universal Smart Contracts and CAF abstract interactions and assets from any chain.### Native Bitcoin access

Bring Bitcoin and its community into dApps, seamlessly. Users and dApps can utilize assets like BTC to interact with and program across all connected chains.### Any Chain, Any Wallet

The Chain Abstraction Framework gives developers the power to bring the best of any chain into their app, while users can access it from any wallet.### Simplified experience

The universal execution layer abstracts transactions across all chains, with logic in a single place, resulting in simplified fees and transaction structures.Build Universal Apps
--------------------

With ZetaChain, the only limit is your imagination. Build and deploy once, and your dApp works seamlessly across blockchains, including non\-smart contract chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

[Start building →](https://discord.gg/zetachain)### Universal DeFi primitives

Key universal DeFi primitives underpin the entire ecosystem. Applications such as universal DEXes (AMM, Perp, PMM, Orderbook, Etc.), lending, CDP, stablecoins, liquid staking, and others provide a seamless and unified universal liquidity hub.

### Bitcoin collateralization and DeFi

ZetaChain enables Bitcoin apps. Bring Bitcoin into DeFi in a native and decentralized way, creating new yield and value creation opportunities for Bitcoin.

### Native token staking, restaking, and data availability

With ZetaChain’s Universal Proof of Stake and access to fungible assets through ZRC\-20, native staking and restaking protocols can be created to power new systems, such as data availability layer integration, BTC/BNB/ETH staking, and more.

### Super aggregators

DApps built on ZetaChain can orchestrate assets and data into various other dApps on connected chains. These super aggregators leverage existing liquidity on external chains for opportunities such as decentralized yield aggregation, savings accounts, and portfolio management.

### Social, gaming, and identity

Create chain\-agnostic user\-focused apps where participants can acquire on\-chain game assets using any token, such as Bitcoin, maintain an identity or domain, or interact with friends on\-chain without needing to hop around networks.

[Contact](mailto:partnerships@zetachain.com)FAQ
---

What is ZetaChain, in simple terms?ZetaChain is both a layer 1 (L1\) blockchain and a smart contract platform with built\-in connectivity to all blockchains and layers. It is the only public blockchain with smart contracts that can manage assets, data, \& liquidity on any chain, even ones that don’t have native smart contract capabilities, like Bitcoin.

Why was ZetaChain created?Crypto is a rapidly expanding industry. New blockchains and layers are created every day for specific use cases: to improve speed, flexibility, and transaction costs for new applications across DeFi, gaming, social, and many more.

  
This innovation is exciting, but it also creates fragmentation in the industry for both developers and users. Setting up new wallets, switching networks, and bridging between blockchains and layers is complicated and often rife with security risks.

  
ZetaChain creates the best of both worlds: it allows innovation in crypto to continue while giving users and developers a simple and secure point of access to every blockchain ecosystem.

  
ZetaChain acts as a gateway for developers and users: we can connect all of the best new blockchains and layers while bringing advanced smart contract functionality to trusted chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

How does ZetaChain work?You can think of ZetaChain as not only an L1 blockchain, but also a functional layer that connects all other blockchains.

  
What goes on behind the scenes:

* Nodes: Our network nodes observe events (e.g., sending a payment) on external chains, reach consensus on them, and sign off to any connected chain.
* Universal smart contracts: Our universal smart contracts read these events from and process them out to external chains. These smart contracts are a single source of truth that maintain the state of assets and data across all connected chains.
* Chain\-agnostic message passing: Existing smart contracts send data and value across chains and layers with a simple function call.
How secure is ZetaChain?ZetaChain uses a simpler and more robust trust model, where only our network is trusted to deliver data/value, vs. a third\-party. On our decentralized proof\-of\-stake network, no single node has knowledge of any private key. ZetaChain can sign and hold assets natively, and funds at rest are never at risk. Since we use ZETA as an intermediary token in the process of sending assets, attack surface is minimized, drastically reducing security risk for users.

What’s unique about ZetaChain?ZetaChain is truly chain\-agnostic and can connect all blockchains and layers, from Ethereum mainnet, L2s and OP Stack chains like Base, to Cosmos chains, and beyond. It even supports non\-smart contract chains like Bitcoin and Dogecoin, giving these chains smart contract capabilities that were never before possible.

  
No other blockchain enables fully interoperable smart contracts and chain\-agnostic udApps (universal decentralized apps). Because of this, ZetaChain has the unique capability of seamlessly and reliably enabling countless use cases across the entire crypto ecosystem.

What does the future look like with ZetaChain?We see the future of web3 as a connected one, where developers can build and leverage the power of many networks seamlessly, and users will no longer have to worry about switching or bridging between them. ZetaChain will be an invisible force powering a seamless user experience for all. No more complex jargon and frustrating UX for users \- they’ll have one place to access all of their assets and data, and can roam the crypto world smoothly and safely.

  
Going forward, we see ZetaChain powering an entire ecosystem of [udApps](https://medium.com/@zetablockchain/omnichain-dapps-a-new-crypto-primitive-a6f05c11961e) across industries: Social, Fashion, Defi \- the sky is the limit! This could look like: gamers being able to access their accounts and in\-game items from anywhere in the crypto ecosystem, owning and transferring NFTs to and from chains, or sending and receiving payments to and from any wallet, regardless of chain. The possibilities are endless.

Tenant, DallasCommon QuestionsFrequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

How does Downstream price junk removal?![downstream]()We price based on how much space your items take up in the service providers truck. Downstream standardizes pricing of all sellers by sizing in total cubic yardage. This providers transparent price comparisons. We break it down into 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 of a truck load, all the way up to a full truck load. The average junk seller truck holds the equivalent of six pickup trucks or 15\-16 cubic yards. Select haulers trucks can hold a ""Mega"" load which is equivalent to 20 cubic yards.  
  
All prices vary based on location, season, local disposal fees and day scheduled. Many junk companies will provide a minimum charge for their teams to remove your item.  
  
Downstream's Scrapper network of individual gig workers provides single item collection services for certain items such as mattresses or TVs and tend to be less than a standard junk company minimum charge.  
  
For materials that have a heavy cubic weight like dirt, concrete, and gravel, pricing is based on the total volume that the material takes up in the truck, up to a maximum of one foot in height for a full truck. You may hear this referred to as a ""heavy"" or ""bed"" load.How do I cancel or change my appointment?![downstream]()You can cancel or change your junk service appointment at anytime. Can you remove large or bulky items?![downstream]()Yes! Our junk haulers will remove large or bulky items as long as they are not on the prohibited items list. Additional fees may apply for extra heavy items which require more than 2 workers to lift such as a pool table, hot tub, or exercise equipment.Can I have an exact price before you arrive?![downstream]()Unfortunately, we can’t give you an exact price until your service provider arrives. Since the price is based on the space used in the back of the truck, they must see the items in person before confirming the quoted price.  
  
 For select single item removals, we can provide more accurate estimates before the appointment, but the final price will always be confirmed onsite with the junk hauler. The junk hauler is responsible for communicating updates to pricing while onsite with the customer and directly in the Downstream app. Can you remove my junk if I am not present?![downstream]()It mostly depends on where the junk is located. If the items are easily accessible and your payment method is on file, we do not require you to be present in order to remove your junk.Are you licensed and insured?![downstream]()Yes, Downstream is a compliant vendor on numerous credentialing programs such as net vendor, real page, and RMIS. We carry multiple insurance policies, background check contractors in our Scrapper network, and work with only the most reliable local junk removal companies in every market.RESOURCESRead latest blogs
