CEO, Vercel

The @mintlify team absolutely nailed combining docs search and AI Q\&A in a delightful experience.](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1716864530775748905)[![Vlad Matsiiako]()Vlad Matsiiako

Co\-founder, Infisical

Mintlify is absolutely amazing! Their team has been such a pleasure to work with, and just look at our docs \- they look gorgeous! I definitely think everyone should try Mintlify out!](https://infisical.com/docs)[![Maayan Salom]()Maayan Salom
============

Co\-founder, Elementary
-----------------------

Mintlify is amazing for us! Even as a small team we struggled to keep up with dev and update the docs on changes. Now the docs are managed as code and are part of the dev process and PR. As an open source project \- moving the docs to the repo (with zero effort) also enabled our community to help us maintain and fix problems as contributors. Our devs and our users love it.](https://docs.elementary-data.com)[![Zeno Rocha]()Zeno Rocha
==========

CEO, Resend
-----------

This is a must\-have if you're building any kind of developer tools. We used other options in the past, which feels outdated in terms of look\-n\-feel when compared to Mintlify. The team helped us set up two different websites and even migrated all the content for us. I can't recommend it enough.](https://resend.com/docs)[![Adam Carrigan]()Adam Carrigan

My team loves Mintlify! Great product and a super supportive team.](https://docs.mindsdb.com)[![Ashley Mulligan]()Ashley Mulligan

Head of Product Engineering, Flatfile
-------------------------------------

Mintlify was the only option that checked all the boxes. To get the look, feel, and features we wanted for our documentation, it had to be homegrown or Mintlify.](https://flatfile.com/docs)[![Chun Jiang]()Chun Jiang

Developer Marketing, Browserbase

Why spend a week coding your own documentation (and optimizing it for SEO, design, etc.) while Mintlify brings you the best in class documentation in a few minutes? Worked on documentation for years, in unicorns and open source and I'm sold!](https://docs.browserbase.com)[![Mark Bao]()Mark Bao
========

Co\-founder, Goody
------------------

The way Mintlify's docs were displayed just felt really user\-friendly for us, and more importantly, for our developer customers.

* [House of Web3](/thehouseofweb3/)
Building the Decentralized Future
=================================

Edge \& Node is the initial team behind The Graph. We create and support protocols and dapps that empower individuals and move humanity forward.

![]()![]()![]()Recognizing the past
--------------------

Modern society has evolved over the past two hundred years around Industrial Age institutions. Banks, Corporations, Universities, and Governments have been the predominent means of scaling human coordination. Capitalism has created a tremendous amount of wealth around the world but institutions have not been able to keep up with the rate of change brought on by the internet.

![]()Decentralized Systems
---------------------

Protocols are internet native institutions that are open and transparent, and can be used to coordinate large numbers of people. With web3, we can rethink what it means to be an effective individual in the Internet Age. How we spend our time, what we value, the way we distribute resources, the big audacious goals we take on—it’s all up for grabs. This is our time to dream big, work hard, and create the future we want to live in.

![]()Our Work

### The Graph

An indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data and making it easily accessible.

What Google does for the web, The Graph does for blockchains. A decentralized network ensures that open data is always available and easy to access. The Graph is used by thousands of protocols and dapps like Uniswap, Synthetix, Aave, Balancer, Zora, Foundation, and more.

Edge \& Node is a team of creators, builders and visionaries accelerating the future at lightspeed. Together, we turn ambitious ideas into tangible reality, breaking through the internet's perceived limitations to reveal abundant opportunity.

#### Connected


A wide range of detailed integrations with major brokers as well as regional and local brokers and funding sources across the country.


![x]() 


#### Reliable


A focus on uptime availability and handling of offline operation when networks fail outside of our control, including outages from mobile networks and internet service providers.


![x]() 


#### Intuitive


A clean and modern feel so dispatching and scheduling is made easy.


 


##### Intuitive Dispatching \& Scheduling


A clean and modern look and feel so handling tasks for dispatching and scheduling is easy. We believe in the value of automation, but we also believe strongly of the need for a human touch in order to provide quality NEMT services. This is why we focus on providing the tools to allow dispatchers and other operators to make the right decisions quickly and efficiently.


##### Native Mobile Apps


You won’t find any gimmicks here! With actual mobile apps for iOS and Android, you’ll enjoy lower data\-consumption, as well as a consolidated solution that offers “lite” tools for mobile dispatchers \& management. This includes providing you with the options on who (ie drivers and/or dispatchers) can use the mobile app to see your fleet vehicle locations, and more.


##### We use Google Maps API


It has become common among many of our our competitors to avoid or move away from integration with the Google Maps API’s due to cost. Mobility Route is committed to providing the best mapping and traffic model information in our solutions, greatly impacting our customers performance, especially in urban areas.


##### Partners \& Integrations


We are staying on the leading edge of innovation and collaboration within the NEMT space. We provide and maintain both API integration and file\-based processes with many national, regional, and even local brokers and programs across the country. We also support other integrations with our partners and other popular software solutions used to handle your daily business.


##### HIPAA Compliance a Top Priority


Many stakeholders in the NEMT industry have come to realize the seriousness of compliance with HIPAA. NEMT operators must ensure they comply with various aspects of this law. Unfortunately its not just as simple as sending drivers through so\-called “HIPAA training” and thinking it only applies to medical information. Any personal identifiable information– even addresses and full names– is subject to protection under the law.


 


###### WHAT WE HAVE


Features made for NEMT
----------------------


 Our solution has always been focused on attention to detail in order to avoid a cookie\-cutter solution seen in most other NEMT software platforms. 


[Take a tour](#) 


###### RETURN ON INVESTMENT


Ensuring transparency \& fairness
---------------------------------


 We believe in being fair and transparent in our pricing as well as our costs of doing business. Ensuring a return\-on\-investment for both our companies in difficult industry is key to a thriving relationship.

#### Why Robotic Process Automation?

 


Robotic process automation will enable you to take your business to the next level with less manual effort, increased productivity and quality. When you implement automation into your day\-to\-day tasks, you can drastically increase productivity rates with less stress and frustration amongst your team members. It also reduces the risk of manual error, enhances security, and allows you to provide better customer service experiences. RPA is precisely what your business needs to grow and thrive over the years.

If you’d like to offer better quality while boosting morale and experiencing more productivity in the workplace, implementing RPA is a must. No matter what industry you’re in, there’s a high probability that automation will work in your favor, leading to better results that help you get ahead of your competition and continue to excel, even throughout some of the most challenging economic times.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

 


What is Drip Innovation by Outamation™?

Outamation Inc prides itself on its emphasis on what we call “drip innovation”. Inspired by drip irrigation, a method to get water directly to the root zone of plants, limiting evaporation while spurring more efficient growth, we seek to incorporate specific changes on a smaller scale to improve the overall performance of your business.

It is important to us that we use business’ investments in the most efficient way and bring our solutions directly to the “root zone” of your business problems. Most consultants seek to incorporate flashy and expensive ideas that cost much more relative to their benefits; even though they might look nice, we strive to take a more delicate approach, offering multiple small\-scale ideas that will focus on your pain points to solve operational and business challenges. Collectively, these smaller innovations lead to a larger return on investment.

For example, if we can automate several tasks that took a couple minutes of work to complete, the time saved will compound and lead to greater benefits than if we had just focused on one issue.

The drip innovation approach leads to operations teams cutting nonvalue tasks and automating repetitive tasks. In large and growing companies that are mired with bureaucratic steps, Outamation can take a surgical approach to spur growth and cut costs. This is often seen as a confidence booster to teams in a business that feel ignored by development projects that solely focus on big ticket items. Another key tenet of our approach is its lack of disruption on a grand scale, avoiding the danger of broad changes cannibalizing revenues. Outamation does not fear disruption or large changes, but rather seeks to make smart investments starting small to remove inefficiencies and then balancing them out with strategic changes to boost profits.


What is RPA?

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology that enables businesses to use software robots to automate specific tasks.

**For e.g.** when applications are not integrated, team members copy paste or type data to do specific processing steps. These tasks can be either completely automated or augment the productivity of the processor by automating cookie cutter tasks, allowing them to focus on just exceptions.


What Processes Suit RPA Automation the Best?

RPA has wide ranging use across any industry or vertical which is based on computer driven processing – either online or client/server application.

**Typical characteristics of ideal candidate for RPA are:**

1. Processes which are not automated of course or not on the roadmap with the technology teams.
2. Processes which are regular and repetitive. These actions don’t change over time and remain constant. Because robots adhere to rules, tasks that are intended for automation should be composed of clear\-cut actions that are carried out consistently. One example is data entry and exception handling, “if this, do that”, rules\-based tasks like online filing of documents, naming conventions, auto responses etc.

Assuming 1 and 2 is met, second important criterion is to choose a process which has high number of transactions to justify the one time effort in setting up RPA and purchasing related licenses.


Can RPA be used in any Software Application?

RPA can automate and integrate data in any application, in any interface, and in any server, including Citrix, and is completely agnostic in this regard.


What are the benefits of RPA for my business?

Robotic process automation offers countless benefits to businesses throughout various industries.

**For example,** you can automate tasks generally completed by humans to drastically reduce the risk of errors occurring during the process. In addition, robotic process automation means getting time\-consuming, tedious tasks completed without stress or frustration.

While improving accuracy and boosting productivity are two good reasons to consider RPA for your infrastructure, those aren’t the only benefits your business can experience when implementing it into daily operations.

RPA will help you ramp up security, improve the experience customers have when dealing with your business, and help you maintain regulatory compliance to avoid potential legal issues. With benefits like these, it’s never been a better time to begin using RPA for your business.


How long does it take for process automation to be implemented?

The time it takes to implement RPA tools into your organization’s infrastructure may vary based on several factors. In some instances, it can take a minimum of two weeks. However, not all scenarios are the same. Some of the most challenging workflows can take up to three months to fully implement robotic process automation. Even if it takes more time to implement, it’s worth it in the long run because it will save your business much more time, effort, and money.


How do I get started with RPA?

Like anything, best step is taking the first step and [contact us](https://outamation.com/contact/) for a free consultation. We bring deep expertise from domain knowledge in specific industries, methodology to do cost effective RPA development and proven strategy to launch. Here are the basic steps –
1. Select a good process candidate for RPA
2. Document key steps and establish success criterion. Goal can be 70%\+ automation.
3. Set a pilot project with us to see benefits in real time
4. Plan the automation roadmap and Governance Plan
5. Continuous improvements

#### How do you guarantee the security of customer data?


 Most hardware on our platform is now hosted in certified data centers.
 But as an additional layer of security, we revoke SSH access from
 our hosts so they cannot access customer data without our knowledge.
   
  

 TensorDock background check all employees and restricts hostnode
 access to only those who need it. We have an agent monitoring
 hostnodes for logins and suspicious activity, from any source.

?


#### How does billing work?


 We operate on a pay as you go model. Users deposit funds,
 and we deduct balance continuously after a server is
 deployed. When your balance reaches $0, your servers are
 automatically deleted. If you need to rent servers long\-term,
 [reach out](/contact.html) to discuss our reserved
 pricing.
 


?


#### Why does the same GPU/CPU have multiple prices?


 We're a marketplace of independent hosts who compete and set
 their own pricing. As the customer, this ensures you
 always have access to the market's best pricing.   
  

 
 Additionally, hosts have different locations and redundancy, 
 leading to varying costs. Our marketplace offers you options to
 pay based on your preferences.
